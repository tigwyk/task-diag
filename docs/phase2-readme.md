# Task-Diag - Phase 2 Implementation

## Completed Features

Phase 2 of the Task-Diag implementation has been successfully completed with the following enhancements:

### Core Functionality Added:
1. **Process Tree Navigation** - Get-ProcessTree function that recursively retrieves parent-child relationships
2. **Detailed Process Information** - Get-ProcessDetails function with comprehensive process data including:
   - Memory usage (working set, virtual memory, private memory)
   - Thread count
   - Parent process identification
   - Module information
3. **Integrated Task Host Information** - Get-TaskHostInfo function that combines all diagnostic data for backgroundTaskHost.exe processes

### Command-Line Interface Enhancements:
1. **Process Tree View** - New "tree" action to display process hierarchies
2. **Enhanced Process Info** - Improved "info" action with better parameter handling
3. **Updated Help System** - Expanded help documentation with new command options

### Module Improvements:
1. **Function Export** - All new functions are properly exported from the module
2. **Error Handling** - Enhanced error handling throughout all new functions
3. **Documentation** - Complete PowerShell help documentation for all functions

## Usage Examples:

```powershell
# List processes (existing functionality)
.\src\taskdiag.ps1 list

# Show detailed information for a specific process
.\src\taskdiag.ps1 info -ProcessId 1234

# Show process tree for a specific process  
.\src\taskdiag.ps1 tree -ProcessId 1234

# Perform full diagnostic analysis
.\src\taskdiag.ps1 analyze
```

## Technical Implementation:
- Utilizes WMI queries for parent-child process relationships
- Implements comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
- Uses PowerShell's built-in Get-Process and Get-WmiObject cmdlets
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

This phase establishes the foundation for more advanced diagnostic capabilities in subsequent phases, providing detailed process information and hierarchical navigation that will be essential for identifying what spawned each backgroundTaskHost.exe process.
